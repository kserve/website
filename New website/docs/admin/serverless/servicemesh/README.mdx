# Istio Service Mesh
## Secure InferenceService with ServiceMesh

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that you can add to your InferenceService to allow you to transparently add capabilities like observability, traffic management and security.
In this example we show how you can turn on the Istio service mesh mode to provide a uniform and efficient way to secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with TLS encryption, strong
identity-based authentication and authorization.

## Turn on strict mTLS and Authorization Policy
For namespace traffic isolation, we lock down the in cluster traffic to only allow requests from the same namespace and enable mTLS for TLS encryption and strong identity-based authentication.
Because Knative requests are frequently routed through activator, when turning on mTLS additional traffic rules are required and activator/autoscaler in `knative-serving` namespace must have sidecar injected as well.
For more details please see [mTLS in Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/istio-authorization/#mutual-tls-in-knative), to understand when requests are forwarded through the activator, see [target burst capacity](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/load-balancing/target-burst-capacity/) docs.

Create the namespace `user1` which is used for this example.
```bash
kubectl create namespace user1
```

- When activator is not on the request path, the rule checks if the source namespace of the request is the same as the destination namespace of `InferenceService`.

- When activator is on the request path, the rule checks the source namespace `knative-serving` namespace as the request is proxied through activator.



:::warning

    Currently when activator is on the request path, it is not able to check the originated namespace or original identity due to the [net-istio issue](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/issues/554).

    - from:
        - source:
            namespaces: ["user1"]
    # 2. mTLS for service from source "user1" namespace to destination service with activator on the path
    # Source Service from "user1" namespace -> Activator(Knative Serving namespace) -> Destination service in "user1" namespace
    # unfortunately currently we could not lock down the source namespace as Activator does not capture the source namespace when proxying the request, see https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/issues/554.
    - from:
        - source:
            namespaces: ["knative-serving"]
    # 3. allow metrics and probes from knative serving namespaces
    - from:
        - source:
            namespaces: ["knative-serving"]
      to:
        - operation:
            paths: ["/metrics", "/healthz", "/ready", "/wait-for-drain"]
```

Apply the `PeerAuthentication` and `AuthorizationPolicy` rules with [auth.yaml](./auth.yaml):

```bash
kubectl apply -f auth.yaml
```

### Disable Top Level Virtual Service 
KServe currently creates an Istio top level virtual service to support routing between InferenceService components like predictor, transformer and explainer, as well as support path based routing as an alternative routing with service hosts.
In serverless service mesh mode this creates a problem that in order to route through the underlying virtual service created by Knative Service, the top level virtual service is required to route to the `Istio Gateway` instead of to the InferenceService component on the service mesh directly.

By disabling the top level virtual service, it eliminates the extra route to Istio local gateway and the authorization policy can check the source namespace when mTLS is established directly between service to service and activator is not on the request path.
To disable the top level virtual service, add the flag `"disableIstioVirtualHost": true` under the **ingress** config in inferenceservice configmap.

```bash
kubectl edit configmap/inferenceservice-config --namespace kserve

ingress : |- {
    "disableIstioVirtualHost": true
    }

```

## Deploy InferenceService with Istio sidecar injection


First label the namespace with `istio-injection=enabled` to turn on the sidecar injection for the namespace.

```bash
kubectl label namespace user1 istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
```

Create the InferenceService with and without Knative activator on the path:
When `autoscaling.knative.dev/targetBurstCapacity` is set to 0,
Knative removes the activator from the request path so the test service can directly establish the mTLS connection to the `InferenceService` and
the authorization policy can check the original namespace of the request to lock down the traffic for namespace isolation.

When you send a prediction request to the `sklearn-iris-burst` InferenceService with activator on the request path from a different namespace, you actually get HTTP 200 response due to the above limitation as the authorization policy is
not able to lock down the traffic only from the same namespace as the request is proxied through activator in `knative-serving` namespace, we expect to get HTTP 403 once upstream Knative `net-istio` is fixed.
