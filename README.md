# KServe documentation

Welcome to the source file repository for our documentation on
https://kserve.github.io/website/

## Website

The KServe documentation website is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### View published documentation

View all KServe documentation and walk-through our code samples on the
[website](https://kserve.io).

The KServe website includes versioned docs for recent releases, the KServe
blog, links to all community resources, as well as KServe governance and
contributor guidelines.

### Run website locally

For instructions, see KServe's [MkDocs contributor guide](docs/help/contributor/mkdocs-contributor-guide.md).

### Website source files

Source files for the documentation on the website are located within the
[`/docs`](docs) directory of this repo.

### Documentation versions for KServe releases

Each release of the KServe docs is available in the website (starting with
0.3) and their source files are all stored in
[branches of this repo](doc-releases.md).

## Contributing to docs
