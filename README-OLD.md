# KServe documentation

Welcome to the source file repository for our documentation on
https://kserve.github.io/website/

## Website

The KServe documentation website is built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

### View published documentation

View all KServe documentation and walk-through our code samples on the
[website](https://kserve.github.io/website/).

The KServe website includes versioned docs for recent releases, the KServe
blog, links to all community resources, as well as KServe governance and
contributor guidelines.

### Run website locally

For instructions, see KServe's [MkDocs contributor guide](docs/help/contributor/mkdocs-contributor-guide.md).

### Website source files

Source files for the documentation on the website are located within the
[`/docs`](docs) directory of this repo.

### Documentation versions for KServe releases

Each release of the KServe docs is available in the website (starting with 0.3)
and their source files are all stored in branches of this repo. Take a look at
the [release process](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/release/RELEASE_PROCESS_v2.md)
