## InferenceService Explainer

Model explainability answers the question: "Why did my model make this prediction" for a given instance. KServe 
integrates with [Alibi Explainer](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) which implements a black-box algorithm by generating a lot of similar looking instances 
for a given instance and send out to the model server to produce an explanation.

Additionally, KServe also integrates with The [AI Explainability 360 (AIX360)](https://ai-explainability-360.org/) toolkit, an LF AI Foundation incubation project,
which is an open-source library that supports the interpretability and explainability of datasets and machine learning models. The AI Explainability 360 Python package includes a comprehensive set of algorithms that cover different dimensions of explanations along with proxy explainability metrics.
In addition to native algorithms, AIX360 also provides algorithms from LIME and Shap.
