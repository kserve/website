# Example Anchors Text Explaination for Movie Sentiment

This example uses a [movie sentiment dataset](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/) to show the explanation on text data, for a more visual walkthrough please try the [Jupyter notebook](movie_review_explanations.ipynb).

## Deploy InferenceService with AnchorText Explainer
We can create a InferenceService with a trained sklearn predictor for this dataset and an associated explainer. 
The black box explainer algorithm we will use is the Text version of Anchors from the [Alibi open source library](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi).
More details on this algorithm and configuration settings that can be set can be found in the [Seldon Alibi documentation](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi/en/stable/).

The InferenceService is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "moviesentiment"
spec:
  predictor:
    minReplicas: 1
    sklearn:
      storageUri: "gs://seldon-models/sklearn/moviesentiment"
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 0.1
          memory: 1Gi       
        limits:
          cpu: 1
          memory: 1Gi         
  explainer:
    minReplicas: 1
    alibi:
      type: AnchorText
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 0.1
          memory: 6Gi
        limits:
          memory: 6Gi
```

Create this InferenceService:

=== "kubectl"
```
kubectl create -f moviesentiment.yaml
```

## Run Inference and Explanation
Set up some environment variables for the model name and cluster entrypoint.

```
MODEL_NAME=moviesentiment
SERVICE_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl get inferenceservice moviesentiment -o jsonpath='{.status.url}' | cut -d "/" -f 3)
```

Test the predictor on an example sentence:

```
curl -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:predict -d '{"instances":["a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise ."]}'
```

You should receive the response showing negative sentiment:

```
{"predictions": [0]}
```

Test on another sentence:

```
curl -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:predict -d '{"instances":["a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes ."]}'
```

You should receive the response showing positive sentiment:

```
{"predictions": [1]}
```

Now lets get an explanation for the first sentence:


```
curl -v -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:explain -d '{"instances":["a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise ."]}'
```

```

This shows the key word "bad" was indetified and examples show it in context using the default "UKN" placeholder for surrounding words.


## Custom Configuration

You can add custom configuration for the Anchor Text explainer in the 'config' section. For example we can change the text explainer to sample from the corpus rather than use UKN placeholders:

```yaml
apiVersion: "serving.kserve.io/v1beta1"
kind: "InferenceService"
metadata:
  name: "moviesentiment"
spec:
  predictor:
    sklearn:
      storageUri: "gs://seldon-models/sklearn/moviesentiment"
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 0.1
  explainer:
    alibi:
      type: AnchorText
      config:
        use_unk: "false"
        sample_proba: "0.5"	  
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 0.1
```

If we apply this:

=== "kubectl"
```
kubectl create -f moviesentiment2.yaml
```

and then ask for an explanation:

```
curl -H "Host: ${SERVICE_HOSTNAME}" http://${INGRESS_HOST}:${INGRESS_PORT}/v1/models/$MODEL_NAME:explain -d '{"instances":["a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise ."]}'
```
