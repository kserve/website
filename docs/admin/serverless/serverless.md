Kubernetes version.

## 1. Install Knative Serving
Please refer to [Knative Serving install guide](https://knative.dev/docs/admin/install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/).

!!! note
    If you are looking to use PodSpec fields such as nodeSelector, affinity or tolerations which are now supported in the v1beta1 API spec, 
    you need to turn on the corresponding [feature flags](https://knative.dev/docs/admin/serving/feature-flags) in your Knative configuration.
    
!!! warning
    Knative 1.13.1 requires Istio 1.20+, gRPC routing does not work with previous Istio releases, see [release notes](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/knative-v1.13.1).

## 2. Install Networking Layer
The recommended networking layer for KServe is [Istio](https://istio.io/) as currently it works best with KServe, please refer to the [Istio install guide](https://knative.dev/docs/admin/install/installing-istio).
Alternatively you can also choose other networking layers like [Kourier](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier) or [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/), see [how to install Kourier with KServe guide](./kourier_networking/README.md).

The minimally required Cert Manager version is 1.9.0 and you can refer to [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
