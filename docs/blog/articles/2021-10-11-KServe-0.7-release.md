### **🌈 What's New?**

- #### ModelMesh project is joining KServe under repository [modelmesh-serving](https://github.com/kserve/modelmesh-serving)!
    ModelMesh is designed for high-scale, high-density and frequently-changing model use cases.
    ModelMesh intelligently loads and unloads AI models to and from memory to strike an intelligent 
    trade-off between responsiveness to users and computational footprint.
