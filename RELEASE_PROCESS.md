# Release Process for KServe Documentation Website

This document outlines the steps to create a new release for the KServe documentation website. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth release process.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to make changes to the repository.
2. Install the required tools:
   - Node.js and npm
3. Verify that the `Makefile` and `release.sh` scripts are up-to-date.

## Steps

### 1. Update the Version

1. Run the following command to start the release process:
   ```bash
   make bump-version
   ```
2. Enter the new version when prompted. Ensure the new version is greater than the current version.

### 2. Verify Changes

1. Check the `docusaurus.config.ts` file to ensure the following:
   - The `announcedVersion` variable is updated to the new version.
   - The new version is added to the `docsVersionDropdown` field.
2. Verify that the API documentation files are updated in the `docs/reference` directory. Note that the API documentation is automatically generated as part of the `bump-version` process in the `release.sh` script.

### 3. Test the Changes

1. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
2. Navigate to the website in your browser and verify the following:
   - The new version appears in the version dropdown.
   - The announcement bar displays the correct version.
   - All links and pages work as expected.

### 4. Commit and Push Changes

1. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release version <new_version>"
   ```
2. Push the changes to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 5. Create a Pull Request

1. Open a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch.
2. Add a detailed description of the changes.
3. Request reviews from the team.

### 6. Merge and Deploy

1. Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the `main` branch.
2. Deploy the changes to the production environment.

### 7. Post-Release Tasks

1. Verify the live website to ensure the changes are reflected.
2. Announce the new release on relevant channels (e.g., Slack, mailing list).

## Notes

- The `release.sh` script handles most of the release process automatically, including generating API documentation.
- Always test the changes locally before pushing them to the repository.
